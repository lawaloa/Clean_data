The screening procedures felt overly strict, with many people being pulled aside for additional checks, even though they had followed the initial instructions carefully. This caused unnecessary stress and frustration, making it difficult for many of us to reach our gates on time.

The facilities here seem outdated and lack many of the amenities I’ve come to expect when traveling. For example, other airports offer better seating, a wider range of food options, and more efficient customer service. The layout is also confusing, and finding basic services like restrooms or charging stations was more difficult than it should have been. Overall, it would greatly improve the experience if this airport could modernize and provide a more traveler-friendly environment like many others do."
